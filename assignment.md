## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Firstly, we could break down the overall project - such as setting up networks, deploying software, or ensuring cybersecurity into prioritized tasks. This allows the team to focus on specific, achievable goals within each sprint, leading to steady and measurable progress. The daily stand-up meetings, a core element of Scrum, ensure continuous communication, where team members can discuss their progress, address obstacles, and make quick adjustments. This daily collaboration can help in identifying potential issues early on, reducing delays and rework.

Moreover, Scrum’s emphasis on flexibility and responsiveness to change is especially valuable in a startup environment, where requirements might evolve rapidly. By reviewing and adjusting priorities at the end of each sprint, the IT team can quickly adapt to new demands or feedback, ensuring that the most critical tasks are always completed first. This iterative process also promotes continuous improvement, as the team reflects on what worked well and what didn’t during sprint reviews and retrospectives.

Overall, this helps to improve the team's productivity.

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
As a visitor, I want to checkout a list of books, so that I can borrow them.
As a visitor, I want to reserve a particular book, so that I can pick it up when I visit the library.
As a visitor, I want to update my profile, so that I can receive the appropriate reminders / promotions / events of the library.
As a parent, I want to pay off fines, so that I can help my children pay off their library fines.
As a parent, I want to view the due dates of my family's borrowed books, so that I can return the books when they are due.
As a library manager, I want to view the analytics of the borrowings, so that I can better forecast and predict the peak periods.
As a library staff, I want to be able to manually assign a book to a user, so that I can help a user borrow a book.
As a library staff, I want to be able to view all existing users, so that I can help to diagnose any potential failure when borrowing books.
As a library staff, I want to update the library catalog, so that the latest books are available for borrowing.
As a library staff, I want to add another library staff, so that I can manage my team member's access to the website.
